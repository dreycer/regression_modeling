## Problem Statement

The ability to appropriately and accurately predict sale prices of homes is incredibly beneficial in a market that is currently oversaturated with buyers. To gain an edge in the market, it would be helpful to know the approximate final selling price of a home before putting in an offer or putting a home on the market.

As a leader in Iowa real estate, we aim to accurately predict the Sale Prices for homes in Ames, Iowa through data cleaning and creating models using Multiple Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge. We will evaluate success by interpreting our R^2 score and the Root Mean Squared Error for each model as well as examining whether the model has an appropriate number of variables.

## Background

Ames is a city in Story County, Iowa, United States, located approximately 30 miles (48 km) north of Des Moines in central Iowa. It is best known as the home of Iowa State University (ISU), with leading agriculture, design, engineering, and veterinary medicine colleges. A United States Department of Energy national laboratory, Ames Laboratory, is located on the ISU campus.

In 2019, Ames had a population of 66,258. Iowa State University was home to 33,391 students as of fall 2019, which make up approximately one half of the city's population.

The Ames Housing Dataset was introduced by Professor Dean De Cock in 2011 as an alternative to the Boston Housing Dataset (Harrison and Rubinfeld, 1978). It contains 2,919 observations of housing sales in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. There are 23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous features describing each houseâ€™s size, quality, area, age, and other miscellaneous attributes.

## Conclusions

My final model that I propose this Iowa Real Estate Agency uses is a linear regression model with 8 features. (Overall Quality ^2, Year Built, Total Basement Square Feet, 1st Floor Square Feet, Above Ground Living Area (sqft), Neighboorhood scalar, Kitchen Quality (ordinal value - 1-5 scale)). 

I greatly limited the number of variables in my final model due to the fact that we only had a data set of around 2,000 points. I also needed the model to be usable for the real estate agents. Collecting and entering 8 values in a model is a reasonable ask to determine the sale price of home with an average error of around $30,000. I would not recommend my more complicated models even though they had a slightly lower average error. In order to improve the error significantly, the model would require upwards of 24 variables/features. 

My final model also performed well on unseen data, which is an indication that it would be useful in its predictive power. 

As a final product, my equation was provided to the realty company, as well as my neighborhood scalar list. Real estate agents would then be able to calculate predicted sale price by hand. However, I agreed to work with the team further to develop an internal app so agents could calculate the value simply by entering the 7 pieces of numerical information needed along with choosing a neighborhood from a drop-down menu.
